# Temperature
Temperature converter
This program prompts the user to enter a temperature and the current unit of the temperature. It then uses a switch statement to determine the conversion factor for the given temperature unit and applies it to the temperature. It will print the temperature in all the units (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, Rankine) and it will validate the input unit.
It's important to notice that this code assumes that the inputs are valid and doesn't have any input validation.
